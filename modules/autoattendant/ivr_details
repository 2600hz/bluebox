IVR:
- Playfile initial greeting
- Playfile (second+ tries)
- Playfile for error
- Playfile for retry message
- Playfile for too many tries

- # of Digits (optional, defaults to auto-detect via numbering plan)
- Timeout
- Timeout dest
- Invalid
- Invalid dest
- Number of Errors
- Error out dest
- Inter-digit timeout
- Count errors globally? (true/false)

IVR DIGIT MAPPINGS:
- id
- digit
- destination

IVR MODULE MAPPINGS:
- id
- module_id
- context (optional)


IVR allows "digits" to override "mappings"
IVR is responsible for making sure that no two results of module + context number lookups overlap
# of errors should be set as a channel variable on/before exiting the IVR, so if the person ever ends back up in an IVR and continues to error out, we count this globally
Can use a perl program to compress to regexs like numbers
Regex compression scheme can be used in multiple places, not just IVR



FIND OUT FROM FREESWITCH GUYS:
- How to tell if a number exists, when coming from an IVR, so we can stay in the IVR if the input is invalid (w/out having to use RegExs/etc.)
- How to wait for # of digits dynamically based on dialplan
