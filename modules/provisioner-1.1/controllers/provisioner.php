/**
 * This is the skeleton controller template.
 * Replace this text with a description of what your module or pages do.
 *
 * All public methods here that are not prefixed with _ are accessible via the
 * url /MyModule/methodname (where "MyModule" is the name of the controller class
 * and "methodname" is the name of the method you define).
 *
 * As an example, if this class is named Voicemail_Controller with a method
 * definition of 'public function send()', you can access it via:
 *
 *      http://myserver/frepbx/voicemail/send
 *
 * You can add your own custom routes by adding the appropriate routing file
 * per Kohana's specifications.
 *
 * Views are automatically rendered for each method unless you override this
 * functionality. The view file rendered, by default, is
 *
 *  modules/mymodule/views/controllername/methodname
 *
 * Using the above example, the view for
 * http://myserver/bluebox/voicemail/send would live in
 *
 *  modules/voicemail/views/voicemail/send.php
 *
 * To set variables that will be accessible in the view, use the format:
 *
 *  $this->view->myvariable = $myvariable;
 *
 * You can then reference those variables as $myvariable within the view itself.
