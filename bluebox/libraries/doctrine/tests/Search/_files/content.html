Database transaction
From <b>Wikipedia<b>, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
A database transaction is a unit of interaction with a database management system or similar system that is treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions that must be either entirely completed or aborted. Ideally, a database system will guarantee the properties of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID) for each transaction. In practice, these properties are often relaxed somewhat to provide better performance.

In some systems, transactions are also called <i>LUWs</i> for Logical Units of Work.
