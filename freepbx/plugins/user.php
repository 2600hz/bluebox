/**
 * user.php - User plugin
 *
 * This is the user plugin. The purpose of making user management a plugin is to allow user management to happen
 * both in a normal login/registration style page, a combined (side by side on same page) login/register page, and
 * to provide the ability to have login or registration boxes dynamically "dropdown" or pop-out from hidden divs, menus,
 * or any other place on the page you might want to provide easy login/register abilities.
